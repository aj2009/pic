Repository for PIC Microcontroller projects.

PIC18F2431/asm/midi.cv.X
------------------------
This is the only real project, the others are basically throwaway tests and samples.

This project drives the MIDI to CV controller box that was built in Jan 2012. 

It listens to all midi channels, and pushes CV Gate, Pith, Velocity, and Mod Controlelr (CC1) outputs.
